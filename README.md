# hello-world
My first repository. Learning this whole GitHub thing.

My name is Rachel and for years I have been programming as a hobby. I started with Lego Robotics and using their drag and drop program creation process. Then went to more advanced robotics using a Board of Education (BOE) board and BASIC. Then moved on to making stupid little websites using HTML. I am currently in a post baccalaureate certificate program for Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and taking a course on Python programming and software development for GIS. My amazing boyfriend got me a raspberry-pi for the holidays and I am excited to get to work on some projects using it! I hope to expand my skills and eventually combine GIS and programming into my future career.
