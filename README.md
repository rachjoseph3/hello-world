# hello-world
My first repository. Learning this whole GitHub thing.

My name is Rachel and for years I have been programming as a hobby. I started with Lego Robotics and using their drag and drop program creation process. Then went to more advanced robotics using a Board of Education (BOE) board and BASIC. Then moved on to making stupid little websites using HTML. I completed a post baccalaureate certificate program for Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with an elective in python scripting in March of 2018. In August of 2018, I started my GIS career as a LiDAR Technician!I feel so lucky to be able to use both of my passions, GIS and programming, in my current job.
